  abstract: "Neurons process information, and that is pretty much all that they do. When a visual neuron sends information to the brain, that information reduces the brain's uncertainty. Thus, in the context of Shannon's theory of information (1948), entropy (uncertainty) and information are two sides of the same coin. But neurons are expensive; in children, the brain soaks up half of the total energy budget. Accordingly, the efficient coding hypothesis (Barlow, 1961) proposes that, when neurons recode the visual data from the eye into a series of digital neuronal spikes, each spike carries as much information as possible for each Joule of energy expended. In this talk, I will describe how the steep rise in the price that neurons pay for information is due to a fundamental limit set by Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem, and how this may account for key properties of neural information processing."
