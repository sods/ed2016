  institute: "Mechanical Engineering"
  abstract: "<p>Engineering is the science, or art, of achieving the best compromise to solve problems. Many Engineers are interested in the optimisation of energy conversion. The earliest work on the second law by Carnot defined limits on the conversion of heat to work (e.g. burning coal to pump water). This was later codified by Clausius and Thomson into the second law of thermodynamics, based on heat, work and temperature. Even though these limits are inviolable, there are ways of sidestepping the laws, but many of the routes to Thermotopia are limited by technology.</p>

<p>This understanding of the first and second laws of thermodynamics have led to the development of two main families of devices, heat engines and refrigerators.  Stephen will show a few basics of Engineering thermodynamics, provide a physical insight into these limits and show some simple ways of spotting perpetual motion machines.</p>"
